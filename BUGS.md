## ARDUPILOT Configurator start minimized, what should I do?

You have to remove `C:\Users%Your_UserNname%\AppData\Local\ARDUPILOT-configurator` folder and all its content.

Alternatively, on Windows with PowerShell you can use `post_install_cleanup.ps1` script that will do the cleaning. (thank you James Cherrill)
